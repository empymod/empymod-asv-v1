# Historic benchmarks for empymod v1.x.

Historic benchmarks for `empymod` up to the latest `v1.x`. The internals of
empymod changed quite a bit over time, and the current benchmarks do not work
any longer all the way back. Also because of failures due to upstream changes
etc. (e.g., most of `transform` for empymod < v2 fail for numpy >= 1.18.).

This repo is simply the archived state of `asv` at the time (3rd May 2020), and
corresponding results.

The results are rendered on
[empymod.github.io/empymod-asv-v1](http://empymod.github.io/empymod-asv-v1/).

For the current benchmarks see
